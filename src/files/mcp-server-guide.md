# üß† MCP Server Overview for Copilot Studio Agent Builders

## üìò What Is an MCP Server?

An **MCP Server** (Message Control Protocol Server) is a lightweight HTTP server that acts as a backend integration point for agents built in **Copilot Studio**. It receives structured requests from agents, processes them (often with custom logic or external API calls), and returns structured responses.

MCP Servers are designed to be:
- Stateless and fast
- Easy to deploy (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, Express)
- Language-agnostic (though Python is common)
- Compatible with Copilot Studio‚Äôs agent flow architecture

## üîç How MCP Servers Differ from Other Tools in Copilot Studio

| Feature                        | MCP Server                          | Built-in Tools (e.g., Power Automate, Plugins) |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Custom Logic**              | Full control via code               | Limited to UI-based logic                      |
| **External API Integration**  | Direct, flexible                    | Often requires connectors                      |
| **Latency & Performance**     | Optimized for speed                 | May introduce overhead                         |
| **Deployment Flexibility**    | Host anywhere (cloud, local)        | Tied to Microsoft ecosystem                    |
| **Debugging & Logging**       | Full visibility                     | Abstracted or limited                          |

MCP Servers are ideal when you need:
- Fine-grained control over request/response logic
- Integration with non-Microsoft APIs
- Custom authentication, caching, or transformation layers

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools You‚Äôll Need

To build and test an MCP Server in Python:

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Flask** or **FastAPI** (recommended for async support)
- **ngrok** (for local tunneling during dev)
- **Copilot Studio Agent Portal** (to configure MCP endpoint)
- **Postman** or **curl** (for testing requests)

Optional:
- **Logging**: `loguru`, `structlog`
- **Validation**: `pydantic`
- **Async**: `httpx`, `FastAPI`

## üí¨ Sample Prompts for Agent Integration

Here are examples of how your agent might interact with your MCP Server:
